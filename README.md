# HasItBeenDone

`ü§îÔ∏èüìãÔ∏èüíæÔ∏è HasThatBeenDone/HasItBeenDone is a database and search tool for connecting up existing works to see if they have been done in a specific way (or at all) so that you can find the solution you are looking for, or confirm that your solution is new. Ruby in the core, Gherkin for the database.`

## Original draft

```markdown
hasthatbeendone.io

Write in: Ruby (core software) Gherkin (software and database)

Why Ruby?

I prefer Ruby over JavaScript when possible, as come on, Ruby is a good language; it is stable, it has a great community, and it is easy to write in. It also feels fitting to pair it with the Gherkin language.

Why Gherkin?

I don't use Gherkin very much, but it seems very fitting for this project, since this project can be effectively implemented in a phrase-based programming language, like Gherkin or Inform7. Inform7 doesn't seem fitting here, so that is why I didn't use it. COBOL would work too, but I don't think it would work as well as Gherkin. Gherkin is a web-based phrase language that pairs well with Ruby. There will be A LOT of .feature files for this projects database.

Website that allows you to enter variables (as code blocks, like Scratch) connect them together, and show you if it has been done, and if so, how

Sample

Hello World + Collection + Maintained + Sorted + GPL3 licensed + GitHub = ?
Hello World + Collection + Maintained + Sorted + MIT licensed + GitHub = https://github.com/leachim6/hello-world/
